A simple plugin loader made through filesystem functions.
To check if your executor supports file functions, run the script below
```lua
print(if isfile and isfolder and listfiles and makefolder and writefile and readfile then "Your executor can run WhySoSirius!" else "Your executor is missing critical functions.")
```
